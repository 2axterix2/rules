Contributing
============

Please note that when contributing you _must_ be a __native speaker__ of the language. Google Translate or High School experience isn't going to cut it.

## Make a new translation

### 1. Click the [+] icon on [this page](https://github.com/OvercastNetwork/rules)

*****

### 2. Create your translation
Paste the contents of [en.haml](https://raw.github.com/OvercastNetwork/rules/master/en.haml) into the editor as a base.

You should name the file `language_code.haml`, select `Spaces`, `4` for the editing options, and make the commit message something like `Add Language Translation`.

Once you're happy with your translation, click __Propose New File__.

### 3. Send a pull request

Now you should be presented with a screen that lets you send a pull request. Enter a brief title and description as necessary. If you need to edit your translation, you can easily do so by navigating to your newly created file on your newly created fork and clicking `Edit`.

Once you're happy with the translation, click __Send pull request__.

### 4. You're done!

Ideally we'd have another native speaker look your work over, however, we may not always have the luxury. Wait for a developer and/or community members to look over your work and possible suggest improvements. Once any outstanding issues have been completed, your work will be merged!
